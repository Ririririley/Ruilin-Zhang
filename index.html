    <h3>Rules of the game: </h3>
    <p> Suppose there is a company that manufactures smartphones and the initial corporate score is 60. <br>
        Players participating in the game are required to draw cards of characters representing different stakeholders and are required to answer 8 questions (4 of which are specific and 4 of which are common).<br> 
        Depending on the choices made, this will result in an increase or decrease in the Enterprise Score.  <br>
        At the end of the game, <br>
        if the business score is less than 60, the business is bankrupt;  <br>
        if the business score is greater than 60 and less than 80, the business is mediocre;  <br>
        and if the business score is greater than 80, the business is way ahead. </p> 
    <h3>The aim of the game is to prompt players to think about how to implement responsible innovation across different stakeholders.</h3>
